### Overview 
Micronaut is a first-person, VR, planetary exploration game. In Micronaut, players can select from two different miniature-sized planets to roam around and explore. The planets are spherical and the player can walk completely around the planet in any direction they choose. There is also a day/night cycle on the planets since the planets rotate on their axis, so there are sunrises and sunsets every few minutes! Each one of the planets is unique and is filled with little points of interest that the player can discover. There is also some simple AI life on the planets that the player can look at. The game is outfitted with a complete interactable menu system, controller based movements, and control guide. My vision for Micronaut  was to create a peaceful experience for the user and create an environment that was fun to explore and interesting to look at. I wanted the game to be an almost meditative experience for the user where they can just relax and enjoy the scenery/effects of the worlds I built. There is no action or conflict in Micronaut, just peace. Micronaut  was developed for the Oculus Quest 2 in Unity with the programming done in C#. All the assets were created by hand in Blender and assembled within Unity as well.

(the source files for the game were unfortunately corrupted and unrecoverable, but the apk still works if you install it on an Oculus headset)
